Paper reading stack by order

alisa:read_stack

Each foler includes paper itself, its supplementary documents(mostly summarized by myself, will not copy whole chapter from book), and my idea(if possible).
The structure or relationship between all files is in the tree.txt
Eg:
chapter a ------- paper 1 --- paper 2
		/	    /
chapter b -----/	   /
			  /
chapter c ---------------/
